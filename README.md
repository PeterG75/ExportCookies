# Export Cookies

Adds a browser action to save all cookies in a standard `cookies.txt` file. Note that unlike similar extensions such as [cookies.txt](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookies-txt/) it does not add the `#HttpOnly_` prefix for [HttpOnly](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#Secure_and_HttpOnly_cookies) cookies as it is not correctly parsed by some downloaders like [youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl).
